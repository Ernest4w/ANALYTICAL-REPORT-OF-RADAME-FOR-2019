ANALYTICAL REPORT OF RADAME  FOR 2019

1. Introduction
This technical report presents a comprehensive analysis of RADAME’s sales performance using an interactive business intelligence dashboard. The dashboard consolidates transactional sales data across regions, products, categories, customers, cities, and sales personnel. The objective of this report is to translate visual insights into actionable business intelligence that supports strategic planning, operational efficiency, and revenue optimization.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to:
•	Evaluate revenue distribution across regions and cities
•	Identify top-performing products, categories, customers, and salespeople
•	Understand pricing behavior and quantity contribution
•	Assess shipping cost implications
•	Support data-driven decision-making for sales expansion and cost control

3. Story of the Data
The dataset represents sales transaction records aggregated into meaningful dimensions:
•	Geographical: Region and City
•	Product-based: Product name and category
•	Salesforce: Salesperson performance
•	Customer-based: Revenue contribution by customer
•	Financial metrics: Revenue, unit price, quantity sold, and shipping fees
The dashboard tells a clear business story of where revenue is generated, who generates it, and what products and regions drive performance.

4. Data Splitting and Preprocessing
Data Splitting
The data was logically segmented into:
•	Regional Data (North, East, South, West)
•	Product-Level Data
•	Customer-Level Data
•	Salesperson-Level Data
•	Geographical City-Level Data
Preprocessing Steps
•	Aggregation of transactional data into sums and averages
•	Removal of duplicate sales records
•	Standardization of region and product naming
•	Validation of missing values and numerical consistency
•	Formatting of financial metrics into thousands (K) for clarity

5. Pre-Analysis
Before deep analysis, key metrics were identified:
•	Total Revenue: 435.04K
•	Total Shipping Fee: 43.66K
•	Primary City: Boise
•	Regions in Scope: North, East, South, West
Initial observation indicates a moderate shipping cost relative to revenue, suggesting logistics efficiency but with potential optimization opportunities.

6. In-Analysis
Regional Performance
•	North Region leads revenue contribution (≈32.56%)
•	East, South, and West show relatively balanced but lower contributions
Product Pricing Trend
•	High-priced products such as Coffee and Curry Sauce drive higher unit price totals
•	A gradual decline in unit price contribution across lower-margin products suggests product mix diversification
Salesperson Contribution
•	Anne Larsen and Nancy Freehafer dominate quantity sold
•	Indicates strong individual performance concentration within the salesforce
Customer Revenue Distribution
•	Company D is the top customer (≈67K)
•	Revenue dependency on a few major customers is evident

7. Post-Analysis and Insights
•	Revenue is regionally concentrated, with the North outperforming others
•	Product revenue is driven more by pricing strength than volume
•	Sales performance shows uneven contribution among sales staff
•	Customer base shows moderate concentration risk
•	Shipping costs remain controlled but significant enough to warrant monitoring

8. Data Visualizations & Charts
The dashboard employs:
•	Bar Charts – Regional revenue and customer comparison
•	Line Chart – Unit price trend by product
•	Donut Chart – Revenue distribution by region
•	Treemap – Salesperson quantity contribution
•	Geographical Map – Revenue by city
•	KPI Cards – Total revenue, shipping fees, and top city
These visualizations enhance pattern recognition, comparison, and executive-level interpretation.

9. Recommendations and Observations
Recommendations
1.	Expand sales strategies in East and South regions to balance revenue distribution
2.	Reduce dependency on top customers by diversifying the customer base
3.	Implement targeted incentives for underperforming sales personnel
4.	Review logistics and shipping optimization strategies to reduce overhead
5.	Promote high-margin products with strong pricing performance
Observations
•	Strong regional dominance can expose the business to localized risk
•	Salesperson productivity varies significantly
•	Product pricing plays a major role in revenue generation

10. Conclusion
The RADAME dashboard provides a clear, data-driven overview of organizational sales performance. While overall revenue performance is strong, opportunities exist in regional expansion, customer diversification, and salesforce balancing. Leveraging these insights will enable RADAME to strengthen revenue resilience, optimize operations, and sustain long-term growth.
